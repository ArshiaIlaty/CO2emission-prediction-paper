# CO2 Emission Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict CO2 emissions using machine learning models based on a dataset containing CO2 measurements over time. The goal is to develop models that accurately forecast CO2 levels for environmental analysis.

## Installation
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script or notebooks to train models and make predictions.

## Usage
To train models:
- Run `Model.py` with specified parameters or use provided Jupyter notebooks.

To make predictions:
- Use the trained models to predict CO2 levels on new data.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of CO2 measurements over time, including various features related to environmental conditions. The data is stored in CSV format.

## Models Used
This project utilizes the following machine learning models:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Results
Findings from the models and their performance:
- Linear Regression: MSE = , R^2 = 
- Decision Tree Regression: MSE = , R^2 = 
- SVM Regression: MSE = , R^2 =
